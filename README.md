Sequelize
MySQL
Insomnia Core (for testing API routes)
## Configuration

## Database creation and seeding
Enter the schema and seed commands to create a development database and seed it with test data.

## Running the application
Enter the command npm start to invoke the application to start the server and sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database.

## Testing API routes
Open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags to display the data in a formatted JSON. Test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core to successfully create, update, and delete data in the database.

## Conclusion
With these steps, you should have a functional Express.js API connected to a MySQL database using Sequelize and able to perform CRUD operations.
